# Graph

Graph Review
Fantastic work! We’ve implemented a robust graph data structure in Python. Our two classes, Vertex and Graph are capable of representing the typical variations in graphs that occur in many different algorithms.

Vertex:

Uses a dictionary as an adjacency list to store connected vertices.
Connected vertex names are keys and the edge weights are values.
Has methods to add edges and return a list of connected vertices.
Graph:

Can be initialized as a directed graph, where edges are set in one direction.
Stores every vertex inside a dictionary
Vertex data is the key and the vertex instance is the value.
Has methods to add vertices, edges between vertices, and determine if a path exists between two vertices.
Instructions
Great work implementing a graph. When tackling complex problems, it’s a massive advantage if you can model the problem as a graph.

You’ll see this data structure often while working on algorithms, especially those that focus on networks.
